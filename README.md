Verify if API is up and running http://localhost:3000/api/v1/health_check

## API Usage
This API requires authentication using API keys. All requests must include a valid API key.

A simple end-point is created to generate an API key.

### Generate API Key
Send a POST request to the http://localhost:3000/api/v1/api_keys endpoint with the app_name in the request body. (use your preferred API testing tools like Postman, Curl)

Request header: \
Content-Type: application/json \

Request Body:

```bash
{
    "app_name": "TrustedApp"
}
```

This should return a response with "api_key" and "app_name"

```bash
{
  "api_key": "YOUR_GENERATED_API_KEY",
  "app_name": "TrustedApp"
}
```

#### Save the generated API key as you will need it to authenticate your requests.

### Reservation Endpoint
To create a reservation, send a POST request to the api/v1/reservations endpoint.
Provide a payload with reservation details, including the guestâ€™s information and reservation dates.

Request: \
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/reservations \
Content-Type: application/json \
X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY

Body:
```bash
